**Features**

-Clean and user-friendly menu

-Retrieves and logs the IP address information of clients connecting to the port

-Keeps the port open at all times (unless manually closed)

-Swiftly shuts down everything when the application is closed, without the need for a 'BackgroundWorker' process

-Continues listening even after successful completion of logging.

## The menus are in English for now, but I will update them in Turkish as soon as possible.


## **🛠️ Launch**
